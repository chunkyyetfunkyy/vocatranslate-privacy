            <strong>HIPAA COMPLIANCE NOTICE:</strong> VocaTranslate is designed as a HIPAA-compliant communication aid for healthcare professionals. Pacific Digital Ventures LLC has established Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure to ensure Protected Health Information (PHI) is handled in accordance with HIPAA requirements.
